# ADVENTURE_GAME

UDACITY INSTRUCTIONS:

This proyect is a simple version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game. 

The game will present you some scenarios and ask you to make one of 2 choices, by entering 1 or 2. In your notepad, record what happens each time you make a certain choice.

As you can see, this is only a very short game with a couple of choices available to the player. 

The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time.
The game has conditions for winning and losing.
When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.

Project Instructions
1. Print descriptions of what's happening for the player
2. Pausing between printing descriptions
3. Give the player some choices
The program prints the introduction of the game, with short pauses in between each sentence. Another important element of any good adventure game is choice.
Each time we make a choice, something happens, and we are offered 2 choices again till we win or lose. For now, just focus on writing code for the 2 choices you have.

If the player knocks on the door of the house, what happens?
If the player enters the cave, what happens?
We will be dealing with subsequent choices after the first choice in the upcoming steps.

4. Make sure the player gives a valid input
An important thing to notice in the example game is that if the player enters something other than 1 or 2, the game keeps asking them for a 1 or 2. We don't want the game to accept invalid input.

5. Add functions and refactor your code
Th functions are defined
6. Use randomness in your game
Another key feature of most games is randomness or chance. 

7. Create win and lose conditions
Eventually, the game should come to an endâ€”and tell the player that they won or lost.

The end result of the game should be influenced by the player's choices (and possibly some degree of randomness as well).
